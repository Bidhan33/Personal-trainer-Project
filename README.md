Personal Training Project
Project Overview
This project is a Personal Training Management Application that allows users to manage customer training activities. It is built with React for the frontend and Material-UI for styling. The project includes features such as managing training sessions, viewing customer details, using a calendar view for upcoming sessions, and displaying training statistics using Chart.js.

Features
Customer Management: View and manage customer training details.
Training List: Display a list of training sessions with customer data.
Calendar View: View the upcoming training sessions in a calendar format.
Statistics: Display training statistics using bar charts with Chart.js.
Form for Adding Training: Add new training sessions through a form.
Search Functionality: Search through training sessions and customers.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Material-UI
Data Visualization: Chart.js for training statistics visualization
Routing: React Router DOM for page navigation

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-training-project.git
2. Install dependencies
Navigate into the project directory and install the required dependencies:

cd personal-training-project
npm install
3. Run the application
Start the development server:

npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Components Overview
1. App.jsx
Purpose: The entry point of the application. Sets up routing for different pages (e.g., TrainingsList, CustomersList, Statistics, Calendar) and includes the SearchAppBar component for filtering functionality.
State Management: Manages the search query state that filters displayed training data.
2. TrainingsList.jsx
Purpose: Displays a list of all the training sessions.
Features:
Retrieves and displays training data.
Allows filtering of sessions based on customer or training details.
3. Statistics.jsx
Purpose: Displays training statistics in the form of a bar chart using Chart.js.
Features:
Visualizes training session data, such as training durations, using bar charts.
4. AddTraining.jsx
Purpose: Provides a form to add new training sessions.
Features:
Allows users to input details of new training sessions (e.g., customer, training duration, and date).
After adding a training session, the training list updates with the new entry.
5. SearchAppBar.jsx
Purpose: A search bar for filtering the training list.
Features:
Allows users to search for training sessions by customer name or session details.
The search input updates the displayed results dynamically.
Data Handling and API Integration
1. API Calls
The project includes a utility to fetch data from an API (api.js). You can modify the API functions to interact with your backend (e.g., fetching training sessions, adding new ones).

Example of fetching training data:

export const fetchTrainings = async () => {
  // Replace with your API endpoint
  const response = await fetch('/api/trainings');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};
2. Adding New Training
To add a new training session, the form in AddTraining.jsx sends a request to the backend:

const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const newTraining = { customer, duration, date };
  // Send the data to the backend to save the new training
  await fetch('/api/trainings', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(newTraining),
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  });
};
Data Visualization
1. Barcharts.jsx
This component visualizes the training data using Chart.js. It takes the training data as input and renders a bar chart:

import { Bar } from 'react-chartjs-2';

const Barcharts = ({ data }) => {
  const chartData = {
    labels: data.map(training => training.customer),
    datasets: [
      {
        label: 'Training Duration',
        data: data.map(training => training.duration),
        backgroundColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
        borderColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
        borderWidth: 1,
      },
    ],
  };

  return <Bar data={chartData} />;
};
Error Handling
For better error handling, consider adding error boundaries around critical components. React provides a simple way to handle errors with ErrorBoundary components, which can be wrapped around pages like Statistics or TrainingList to catch runtime errors.

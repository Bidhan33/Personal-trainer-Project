Project Overview

The Personal Training Project is a web application designed to help manage customer training activities. Built using React, the project allows users to organize, display, and track customer training sessions, visualize statistics, and provide easy-to-use interfaces for both managing and viewing training data. Material-UI is used for styling and layout, while Chart.js is integrated for data visualization (e.g., bar charts) to represent various training statistics.

Features:


Customer Management: Users can view and manage customer training details, including upcoming sessions and training history.

Training List: Displays a list of training sessions, allowing users to add new sessions and see details of each session.

Calendar View: Shows upcoming training sessions in a calendar format for easy scheduling and tracking.

Training Statistics: Visual representation of training data using charts, like bar charts, to track training durations and customer performance.

Add Training Sessions: Users can add new training sessions by filling out a simple form with details such as customer, training type, and time.

Search Functionality: A search bar allows filtering through training sessions and customer data based on specified criteria (e.g., customer name, training details).





Technologies Used
React:      Used to build the frontend of the application, allowing dynamic content updates and interactive features.

Material-UI:     Provides a clean and responsive design using pre-built components for the user interface.

Chart.js: Integrated for visualizing training data, including statistics like training duration and customer participation.

React Router DOM: Handles the navigation between different views (pages) of the application.







Project Structure:



The application is structured as follows:

Main Components: These include forms for adding new training sessions, lists for displaying training data, and pages for viewing detailed customer or training statistics. The main components include:

A form to add new training sessions.
A page displaying a list of all training sessions.
A page showing statistics using bar charts.
A page with a calendar view of training sessions.
A search bar for filtering training data based on customer or session details.
Data Handling: The application fetches data from an API (or a local state, if implemented) to display training session information, customer details, and session statistics.

Data Visualization: The statistics page uses Chart.js to visualize training session data, such as the total number of sessions per customer, the duration of each session, and other related statistics. This makes the data more accessible and easier to interpret.

Routing: React Router is used to handle navigation between different pages in the application, such as the customer list, training sessions list, and training statistics.

Workflow
Adding Training Sessions:

Users can add new training sessions by filling out a form with customer details, session duration, and date.
Once submitted, the session is saved, and the training list is automatically updated to reflect the new entry.
Viewing Training Data:

The training sessions are displayed in a list format, showing essential details such as the customer's name, session duration, and the training date.
Users can search through the sessions using the search bar, filtering the results based on customer names or training details.
Displaying Statistics:

The training statistics are visualized using bar charts. This allows users to see trends and analyze how often specific customers attend sessions, how long they train, and other relevant data.
Navigating Between Pages:
